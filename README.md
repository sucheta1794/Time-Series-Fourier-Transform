## Time-Series-Fourier-Transform
Time series is a series of data indexed over time. Time series forecasting is a way of predicting future events based on past patterns of data over time.
Time series analysis and forecasting are crucial for predicting future trends, behaviors, and behaviours based on historical data. Mostly useful to make informed decisions and identify potential risks. It aids in planning, budgeting, and strategizing across various domains of idustries, healthcare, etc.

## Why Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) ?
Transforming the data into the frequency domain allows to gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of the signal.
